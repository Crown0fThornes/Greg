"harvest" is what people call our Greg discord bot's farming minigame.


**Core mechanic**
Use `$plant` to plant a random crop, then `$harvest` it an hour later to get crops.

Use `$silo` to view all collected crops.

**Farmers Market**
Every week on Sunday (midday Saturday to midday Monday for good measure), a "farmers market" channel in the server will appear where you can sell a subset of your crops in exchange for Greg xp, which can increase your server level or be used to buy things in the `$rss`.

**Thief**
A silo thief likes to steal crops to discourage hoarding. Learn more at `$info thief`.

**RSS**
Purchase upgrades for your harvesting experience using `$rss` and opening the minigames section. Ola $silo $harvest $silo $silo cease $chat <@355169964027805698> February HK schedule for main  <:ff_logo:1111011971953872976>

Tickets will still close on their own time, but this live list gives two new functionalities:

1. Periodically we can go through tickets and ✅ them here to mark them as resolved on our end & delete it from the live list
2. If a ticket autocloses before resolved, 🔄 it and it will reopen how are you 74 already Hello I'm here for 4 million bems https://tenor.com/view/spongebob-patrick-patrick-star-broke-poor-gif-11677033171799781556 test test test test Testing How though... its always exactly that one i feel like they are bots $worlde ougth Hi <@316114265645776896> you good to do the HK this week?😊 $harvest 🤯 YOOO sick!!
