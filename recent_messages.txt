"harvest" is what people call our Greg discord bot's farming minigame.


**Core mechanic**
Use `$plant` to plant a random crop, then `$harvest` it an hour later to get crops.

Use `$silo` to view all collected crops.

**Farmers Market**
Every week on Sunday (midday Saturday to midday Monday for good measure), a "farmers market" channel in the server will appear where you can sell a subset of your crops in exchange for Greg xp, which can increase your server level or be used to buy things in the `$rss`.

**Thief**
A silo thief likes to steal crops to discourage hoarding. Learn more at `$info thief`.

**RSS**
Purchase upgrades for your harvesting experience using `$rss` and opening the minigames section.
