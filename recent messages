slot, grab them before someone else does🍒😅 Oo nice, I need 30 for now, any amount is good ok, puting all I have now 😊 Thankss, managed to clear task https://tenor.com/view/good-news-thumbs-up-gif-26519262 Well i want to be in an nh, so I'll be happy to join garden for some time, then if I have time go to main or junior and prolly either leave when exams comes I'll figure it out but there's months yet to come I see! Can you please confirm that you can do 600 points in derby weekly in Garden in the upcoming month(s)? And would you like to stay in Carnival too or would you like to switch over? Nice job!! <@1368089663910187118> <@1322905749139226656> 😯 Dang....I shouldn't have made giveaways with 7 winners at the same time with my very first HK. I made trouble for myself 😆 That profit is insane. The fact people are willing to spend so much on a game that keeps making it harder and harder to complete each album is crazy to me. I knew they made a bunch of money just based on how much the wild stickers were. It’s definitely a fun game, I think mainly for the fact we get to play together and actually talk/strategize. But definitely not worth spending actual money on. I rather give my money to supercell 🤣 Woah congratulations 🎉🎉🎉 $inventory judy Please guys Yup add my tag below please (: Added Gotcha, nectar bushes please (: Need 1 more Lolllllll so apparently my graduation ceremony is completely sold out and I don't even have a ticket booked to walk, let alone any for my family Got it! Apparently everybody got the email to book over a month ago but I never did He said you can try emailing but it's at least a 14 working days wait for a response at the moment Definitely not worth spending money on. According to their terms of service, if you are a US/Canada citizen, you don’t even have the right to bring a class action suit https://tenor.com/view/rule127-no-memes-gif-23697472 And supercell thankfully has a balance between profit and enjoyment so far so even if the customer service is terrible, customer feedback is taken into consideration. Did you know 80% of Supercell is owned by Tencent, a Chinese Conglomerate? I thought it was a completely Finland based company so I’m learning new stuff every day 🤣 <@&656112994392080384> Happy Saturday everyone! I hope you all are staying nice warm today.
